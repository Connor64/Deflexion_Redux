# Deflexion_Redux
This project is a 2D, top-down space shooter "Metroidvania" game. It is built in Monogame/Microsoft XNA using C#. I am the programmer for this project and I'm working with 2 other people to develop the art and music assets. We all work collaboratively for the design.

The game is currently not in development due to a shift in focus towards academics as each member began to enter their college careers.
